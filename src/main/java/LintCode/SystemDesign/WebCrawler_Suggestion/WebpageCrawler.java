 * Implement a webpage Crawler to crawl webpages of http://www.wikipedia.org/. To simplify the question, let's use url

 * 
 * Your crawler should:
 * 
 * Call HtmlHelper.parseUrls(url) to get all urls from a webpage of given url. Only crawl the webpage of wikipedia. Do
 * not crawl the same webpage twice. Start from the homepage of wikipedia: http://www.wikipedia.org/
